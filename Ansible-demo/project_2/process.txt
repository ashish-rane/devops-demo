To provision on AWS using ansible






For AWS we dont need a static inventory files since the IP address will change everytime we 
stop and start the instances.
Instead we tell ansible to build the inventory dynamically using script.
>ansible-playbook -i ec2.py ( The python file can be downloaded from ansible website)

On AWS 
Create a new IAM user in AWS
Configure Credentials in ~/.aws/Credentials (The credentials are generated using awscli and used by install
 to access your AWS account)

 - Create user (Generate access key for user which allows us to access aws using api) 
   - Copy the security credentials into ~/.aws/credentials
 - Create a group - Give admin rights to this group
 - assign user to group

On Ansible machine:
>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-pip
>sudo pip install boto awscli
> aws configure - this will generate a file ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials

import ssh keypair
> aws ec2 import-key-pair --key-name ansible --public-key-material file://~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Playbook modifications
- To find the values of Subnet and security group go online to AWS console and look under VPC.

>vim hosts => [localhost] 127.0.0.1

Run Playbook
>ansible-playbook -i hosts ec2.yml
